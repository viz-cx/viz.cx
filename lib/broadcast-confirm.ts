/**
 * On-chain confirmation for broadcast transactions.
 *
 * `network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction` (the async variant we're forced
 * to use — see makeBroadcastTransport in lib/award-broadcast.ts) resolves as soon as
 * the node's RPC layer *accepts the call*. It does not report whether the tx passed
 * validation, so a rejected tx (bad signature, insufficient funds, …) looked
 * like a success to the caller.
 *
 * We close that gap by watching the same live op stream the home feed consumes
 * (`wss://api.viz.cx/ws/ops`, already allow-listed in the CSP) for the op we
 * just sent. Match → confirmed, with the block it landed in. Silence → we say
 * so instead of claiming success.
 *
 * Ported from network.viz.cx/web/lib/broadcast-confirm.ts (Task 11a), unchanged
 * except WS_URL now reads a locally-defined env var instead of importing it
 * from that repo's ./config.
